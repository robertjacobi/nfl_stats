Our project is to analyze NFL regular season play-by-play statistics from 2008-2017 and identify the rate of first down, rate of touchdown, and avg yards per play based on the following criteria:

 - Play Down (1-4)
 - Play Type (Run/Pass)
 - Play Direction (Left, Middle, Right)

By the end of the project, we will be able to statistically determine what play type and direction to choose based on what down and amount of yards needed.

Our data was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016)
